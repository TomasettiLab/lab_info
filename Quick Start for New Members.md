# Quick Start For New Members

1. Set up your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
   * Once you have your username, send it to us so we can add you to the TomasettiLab organization. 
   * Request free student or researcher [benefits](https://education.github.com/) from GitHub using your school e-mail address.
2. Get access to computing clusters
   * If you are a student in the biostatistics department, sign up for the [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/) cluster ASAP. Don't wait until you need to use it because it will take time to get approved and attend the mandatory orientation.
   * You can sign up for other clusters on an ad-hoc basis.
3. Get added to Cristian's [lab members](https://www.cristiantomasetti.com/people/) webpage (i.e. send a photo)
